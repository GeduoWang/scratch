# Scratch C++ Template

This file will pop up when you open the `index.html` file generated by Doxygen.

It is the place for more background on what your project does (as opposed to the more "how to
build it"/"how code is structured"-like stuff in the main README.md) so people reading the code or
the autogenerated doxygen documentation have it easier ;).

# Scratch

Nonsensical code only existing to fill this template with something.

## Applications

### app

Runs some silly functions included from the libraries *lib_stanley* and *lib_ruben* and the two 
source files it is composed of: meet Ernset and Linwood!

## Libraries

### Stanley

A dynamic guy.

### Ruben

A pretty static dude.

Refer to `STRUCTURE.md` for further details (if you're inside the Doxygen HTML right now click on
"Related Pages" at the top - there you'll find it!).
